# lnut-client

a hacked client for languagenut, that autocompletes repetitive tasks. makes languagenut homework less of
a grind, so you can focus on things that actually help you learn. 

## what it does
- fetch all homeworks
- autocompletes any number of tasks - even all of them if you want (thanks to swyift for this change)

## how to use
- go to [smellyelephant.github.io/lnut-client](https://smellyelephant.github.io/lnut-client)
- OR clone the repo and run a local copy
- log in using your normal credentials
- select the tasks you want to do
- click DO THE HOMEWORKS
- have a snack and relax

## DISCLAIMER
this automates the entire languagenut homework process, bypassing the need to even log
into the site. although it allow you to breeze tasks, use only on repetitive, boring homework assignments, __*not* for cheating on tests, quizzes or assessments.__
finishing homework using lnut-client doesn't mean you've learned the stuff. revise it if you're unsure. 
use at your own risk responsibly, don't be that idiot!


__I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU'RE CAUGHT XD__


## notes
- fully dependent on languagenut API, changes to the API could break things
- dependent on being able to fetch the answers from the server
- changes, ideas are welcome - feel free to fork!
